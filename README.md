## What it does ?

1) Searches 'wingify' on google
2) Clicks the first link (wingify website)
3) Navigates to 'Our team'
4) Fetches names of all the employees
5) Save all the names to a .txt file

### First 3 steps can be combined to just one i.e. goto('link_to_our_team'), but left like this for learning purpose.
